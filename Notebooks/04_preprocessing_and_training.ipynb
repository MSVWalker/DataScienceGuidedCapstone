    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

This is frequently a cause of confusion for newcomers who, reasonably, ask how can a squared value be negative?\n",

    "Recall the mean can be denoted by $\\bar{y}$, where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^ny_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and where $y_i$ are the individual values of the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total sum of squares (error), can be expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$SS_{tot} = \\sum_i(y_i-\\bar{y})^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above formula should be familiar as it's simply the variance without the denominator to scale (divide) by the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The residual sum of squares is similarly defined to be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$SS_{res} = \\sum_i(y_i-\\hat{y})^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{y}$ are our predicted values for the depended variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient of determination, $R^2$, here is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R^2 = 1 - \\frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it into words, it's one minus the ratio of the residual variance to the original variance. Thus, the baseline model here, which always predicts $\\bar{y}$, should give $R^2=0$. A model that perfectly predicts the observed values would have no residual error and so give $R^2=1$. Models that do worse than predicting the mean will have increased the sum of squares of residuals and so produce a negative $R^2$."

If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",

Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

In simple cases with no feature selection or imputation or feature scaling etc. you may see the classifier or regressor object itself directly passed into `GridSearchCV`. The other key input is the parameters and values to search over. Optional parameters include the cross-validation strategy and number of CPUs to use."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

    "Time to select your final model to use for further business modeling! It would be good to revisit the above model selection; there is undoubtedly more that could be done to explore possible hyperparameters.\n",
    "It would also be worthwhile to investigate removing the least useful features. Gathering or calculating, and storing, features adds business cost and dependencies, so if features genuinely are not needed they should be removed.\n",
    "Building a simpler model with fewer features can also have the advantage of being easier to sell (and/or explain) to stakeholders.\n",
    "Certainly there seem to be four strong features here and so a model using only those would probably work well.\n",
    "However, you want to explore some different scenarios where other features vary so keep the fuller \n",

    "The business is waiting for this model and you have something that you have confidence in to be much better than guessing with the average price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, rather, you have two \"somethings\". You built a best linear model and a best random forest model. You need to finally choose between them. You can calculate the mean absolute error using cross-validation. Although `cross-validate` defaults to the $R^2$ [metric for scoring](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#scoring) regression, you can specify the mean absolute error as an alternative via\n",

    "**Q: 1** Write a summary of the work in this notebook. Capture the fact that you gained a baseline idea of performance by simply taking the average price and how well that did. Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "* Step 1: Baseline'd performance using the average price as a ticket price predictor\n",
    "* Step 2: Built a refined linear model using cross-validation determining which and how many features were optimal\n",
    "* Step 3: Built a Random Forest Regressor model, also utilizing cross-validation.\n",
    "* Conclusion: Random Forest Regressor Model had the best performance with a MAE of $9.54 on our test data subset. This improved upon the $19.13 MAE of using just the average price.\n",
    "\n",

    "Prior to building a machine learning model we first baseline'd performance by simply taking the average price and measuring how useful this was as a predictor. Highlights included: \n",
    "   * Splitting the data in a 70/30 split, 70% of data was used to train models, and 30% of data was used to test our model.  \n",
    "   * Metrics such a R^2 (coefficient of determination), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE) were used to judge performance.  \n",
    "   * This resulted in a R^2 = -0.003, MAE = $19.13, and MSE = 581.44  \n",
    "    \n",
    "Next we built a linear model to improve on our simple average price baseline. \n",
    "  *  Used sklean to build a pipeline (impute missing values with median for each feature) —> scale the data to zero mean and unit variance —> train a linear regression model.\n",
    "   * The linear model with imputed median values improved results. R^2 = 0.72, MAE = $9.40, and MSE = 161. \n",
    "\n",
    "Refining the linear model:\n",
    "* We suspected the model was overfitting as the features we used were chosen blindly. By judiciously subsetting features this should generalize better. \n",
    "* Cross-validation used for estimating model performance, and it was found the model best performed with a k value of 8. High k values increased variance likely a result from overfitting. \n",
    "* Looking in to which features were most useful for our best model (k=8) it showed that our biggest 5 positive features were vertical drop, snow making ac, total chairs, fast quads, and number of runs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Random Forest Regressor: \n",
    "* Utilized sklearn’s RandomForestRegressor class to implement a random forest model. \n",
    "* Defined the pipeline -> Fit and assessed performance using cross-validation -> Hyperparameter search using GridSearchCV\n",
    "* Imputing the median helped but scaling the features did not. \n",
    "* Random Forest regressor found fastQuads, Runs, Snow Making acreage, and Vertical Drop as the top 4 features of importance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Baseline performance with using just the average price: \n",
    "* On training data: Did not subset\n",
    "* on test data: MAE = $19.13\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression Model Performance:\n",
    "* Cross-validation subset: MAE = $10.50 with a standard deviation of $1.62\n",

    "Random Forest Regression Performance:\n",
    "* Cross-validation subset: MAE = $9.64 with a standard deviation of $1.35\n",
    "* On test data: MAE = $9.54\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation vs. Test Data result comparison:  \n",
    "* Random Forest performed better on the test subset compared to the cross-validation, however our Linear Regression model performed worse when comparing the cross-validation results and test data set. Generally though cross-validation results matched test data result.  \n",
    "Final Conclusion:\n",
    "* Based on Random Forest having a MAE of $9.54 we recommend using this model compared to our Linear Regression model with a MAE of $11.79 on the test data set."
